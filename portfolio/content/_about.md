I am a level designer with extensive experience in Unity since 2018, specializing in creating low-poly environments. My skill set includes a background in animation, and I primarily use Blender for my 3D modeling. All my textures are meticulously hand-drawn, contributing to the unique, stylized aesthetic of my work. I favor a low-poly, janky look, which aligns well with the demands of solo development and allows for creative flexibility.
